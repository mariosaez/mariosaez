Throughout my career, I have gained experience in both frontend and backend development using technologies such as:
-React
-TypeScript
-Kotlin
-Java
-Spring Boot
-Struts
-JSP
-Apache
-SQL
-PostgreSQL
-Oracle
-Jenkins
-AWS
-JUnit
-Mockito

Currently, I have been working as a fullstack software developer for two years, where I have had the opportunity to participate in innovative projects and collaborate with multidisciplinary teams to create efficient and high-impact solutions.

I am increasing my knowledge in frontend technologies by doing projects with TypeScript and React. I hold an official B2 English certification.

I consider myself a very proactive and outgoing person with strong communication skills. What stands out most about me as a worker is my ability to take the initiative and assume any role or responsibility when necessary. I thrive under pressure and embrace responsibility in management. I don't like to just watch things happen; I want to participate as much as possible in all phases.
